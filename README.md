# The Greg-Bot
A Discord.py bot that communicates with my Arduino (via serial over bluetooth).

## What will it do?
The Greg-Bot will be able to move my Arduino based car, soon to turn into a Raspi based car, around my room. My friends on Discord can remotely control the bot via commands from their Discord.
